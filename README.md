# Gods-Unchained-EXP-Bot

**This hasn't been updated in over a year, and will not be updated in the future (Gods Unchained has made botting against the rules). This will not work anymore since there have several visual and funtional updates to Gods Unchained, but serves as part of my portfolio now.



Run this to get free exp while you are away from your computer.
Note: This bot gains exp through constantly losing games in ranked constructed,
so DO NOT use this on your account if you care about rank at all.

To work, install Auto Hotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/ . Then download the Bot_Script.ahk file, and run it.

Launch Immutable in fullscreen mode, and input:

Control + Shift + Right Click

If the cursor goes to the center of the "Start" button, you are ready to use the bot!
Otherwise, you'll need to edit the file and input your screen dimensions.
Right click on the .ahk file to edit it (it should open in Notepad or the equivalent).
Scroll all the way to the bottom of the file until you see:

;\*\*CHANGE THESE NUMBER TO MATCH YOUR SCREEN RESOLUTION\*\*

xDim := 2560

yDim := 1440

;\*\*DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING\*\* 

surrounded by lots of empty space.

Change these values to your screen resolution.
Then try Control + Shift + Right Click again.
If this puts your cursor in the middle of the start, then scroll all the way back up to the top,
and use those values in the identical section near the beginning.

If this doesn't work, then please contact me because I'll need to figure out how to make it work for you (or you can try to do it yourself).
Note: As of now, it appears to only work on displays with a 16:9 aspect ratio.


Once you have made the appropriate changes (if any), you are ready to start using the bot.

Make sure to use a War deck to maximize functionality (uses the slayer god power and can attack enemy gods.
This funcitonality is very useful against other bots).

Make sure that your immutable client is in full screen, and that whenever the game itself launches, that it is also full screen.
Then just input: Control + Shift + Left Click, and you should be good to go!

Press the Escape key to stop the bot from running.
